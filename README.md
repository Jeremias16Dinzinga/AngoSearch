Develop a system capable of performing advanced searches in the database.

Problem: We have a database with 1 billion pieces of information from the identity records of all Angolans, containing the fields Name, Ticket Number, Date of Birth, Birthplace, Father's Name, Mother's Name, Date of Issuance, Sex, Marital Status, Height, Residence, Province and Expiry Date.

The objective is to find information professionally and quickly.

Therefore: 1. Create a MySQL database with all the fields mentioned above; 2. Develop a search form with Laravel, containing an input corresponding to each field in the table; 3. Add, to the date fields (Issuance, Expiry and Birth Date), an input for each one, allowing searches with delimitations, e.g.: Tickets issued from January to December 2021.

Attention: The database will be provided by us.

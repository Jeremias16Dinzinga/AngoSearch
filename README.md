## AngolaSearch

## Overview: 
The project aims to develop a robust system capable of conducting advanced searches within a vast database containing the identity records of all Angolans. With over 1 billion pieces of information, the database encompasses essential fields such as Name, Ticket Number, Date of Birth, Birthplace, Father's Name, Mother's Name, Date of Issuance, Sex, Marital Status, Height, Residence, Province, and Expiry Date.
Problem Statement: 
The challenge lies in efficiently retrieving specific information from this extensive database. Traditional search methods are impractical due to the sheer volume of data, requiring a solution that enables fast and professional searches.

## Objective: 
The primary goal is to create a MySQL database housing all relevant fields and develop a user-friendly search interface using the Laravel framework. This search form will include an input corresponding to each field in the database, facilitating tailored searches based on specific criteria. Additionally, for date fields such as Issuance, Expiry, and Birth Date, the system will incorporate inputs to allow for refined searches, such as filtering tickets issued within a specified timeframe (e.g., January to December 2021).

By implementing these functionalities, users will have the capability to perform advanced searches efficiently, enhancing productivity and enabling prompt access to pertinent information within the extensive database of Angolan identity records.
